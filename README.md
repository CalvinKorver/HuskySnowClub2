Husky Snow Club Website
"The 3rd Iteration"

This repo contains code that can be deployed to an AWS ec2 instance and hosted with Apache to provide a website. The website itself is mostly HTML code from the "HTML5up" collection of samples. There is obviously some custom JS as well as CSS style changes.
